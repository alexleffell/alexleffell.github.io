Welcome! This page is under construction, but in the meantime here are some tidbits.

I'm currently a second year PhD student in Stanford's bioengineering department, coadvised by Manu Prakash and Aaron Straight. I'm studying the physics of life, using the dinoflagellates as my muse.

Before coming to the bay area I spent a year sailing, traveling north east africa, the middle east and central asia. I also hitchhiked from New Orleans to Pittsburg.

Before that adventure, I lead small hardware teams at small health tech startups in Connecticut, namely <a href="https://www.detect.com/">Detect</a> and <a href="https://hyperfine.io/about/news/hyperfine-liminal-nasdaq">Liminal Sciences</a> (now public through a merger with Hyperfine).

I graduated MIT in 2018 with a double major in mechanical and electrical engineering. Along the way I dabbled in <a href="https://2014.igem.org/Team:MIT">synthetic biology</a>  and hung out at the <a href="https://cba.mit.edu">CBA</a>

Outside of work I'm perpetually creating. Currently I'm playing with soft interfaces for making music, finishing up an electronic drum machine, and messing around with sewing machines.
