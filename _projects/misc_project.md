    I once rescued a 1983 Mercedes 300D from a neighboorhood gas station. Replaced the vacuum pump and the alternator my self. A very special car that gets a lot of attention from the people I'd want attention from. Unfortunately it didn't make sense to take it with me to California

    Doesn't anyone remember egg spoons?? I read about them in the NYT and I had to make one. Fortunately I had access to MIT's basement blacksmithing facility. Scale is hard to see in the picture, but it is about a meter long.
