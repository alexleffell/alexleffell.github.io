    Making an alginate mold of my feet. I later learned that it's a bad idea to cast both feet at once, since the alginate will move. Also, dental material is stronger and more elastic.

    I discovered Durham's water putty, which is cheap and fun to work with. Here I used it to shape the plaster cast of my foot to form a last.
